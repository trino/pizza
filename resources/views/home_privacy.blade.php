            Your credit card info is stored with <A HREF="https://stripe.com/ca/privacy">Stripe</A> and not on our servers. This way, they deal with the security of storing your payment info. We store your account info (user name, email address, delivery addresses, phone number) which we do not give out or sell to other companies
